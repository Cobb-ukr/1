    <h2>Pulpectomy</h2>
    
    <div class="content">
        <h3>What it is:</h3>
        <p>A pulpectomy is a dental procedure performed to remove infected or damaged pulp tissue from a primary (baby) tooth. The pulp contains nerves, blood vessels, and connective tissue. After removing the pulp, the empty chamber is cleaned, disinfected, and filled with a biocompatible material to preserve the tooth until it naturally falls out.</p>

        <h3>Why it's needed:</h3>
        <p>Pulpectomy is necessary when:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A primary tooth has deep decay that has reached the pulp</li>
            <li>There is persistent toothache or sensitivity caused by infected pulp</li>
            <li>Trauma or injury has damaged the pulp tissue</li>
            <li>To prevent the premature loss of primary teeth, which can impact the alignment of permanent teeth</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Pulpectomy Procedure:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Examination and X-rays:</strong> The dentist examines the affected tooth and takes X-rays to assess the extent of the pulp damage.</li>
            <li><strong>Anesthesia:</strong> Local anesthesia is administered to numb the area, ensuring the childâ€™s comfort during the procedure.</li>
            <li><strong>Pulp Removal:</strong> The dentist creates a small opening in the tooth to access the pulp chamber and carefully removes the infected or damaged pulp tissue.</li>
            <li><strong>Cleaning and Disinfection:</strong> The empty pulp chamber and root canals are thoroughly cleaned and disinfected to eliminate bacteria.</li>
            <li><strong>Filling the Chamber:</strong> The cleaned chamber is filled with a biocompatible material (such as zinc oxide-eugenol or calcium hydroxide) to seal the space and prevent reinfection.</li>
            <li><strong>Final Restoration:</strong> The tooth is restored with a filling or stainless steel crown to protect it until it naturally falls out.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Benefits of Pulpectomy:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Preserves primary teeth until they naturally shed</li>
            <li>Prevents premature tooth loss and maintains proper spacing for permanent teeth</li>
            <li>Relieves pain and eliminates infection</li>
            <li>Improves oral health and prevents complications</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Aftercare Tips:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Monitor for mild discomfort or sensitivity, which is normal for a few days</li>
            <li>Encourage gentle brushing around the treated area</li>
            <li>Provide soft foods and avoid hot or sticky foods immediately after the procedure</li>
            <li>Follow all post-treatment instructions from your dentist</li>
            <li>Attend regular follow-up visits to monitor the tooth's health</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Recovery Time:</h3>
        <p>Most children recover quickly from a pulpectomy. Mild discomfort may last for a day or two, but they can resume normal activities shortly after the procedure.</p>
