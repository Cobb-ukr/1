    <h2>Wisdom Teeth Removal</h2>
    
    <div class="content">
        <h3>What it is:</h3>
        <p>Wisdom teeth removal is a surgical procedure to extract one or more of the third molars, located at the back of the mouth. These teeth typically emerge in late adolescence or early adulthood and can sometimes cause issues if they become impacted or misaligned.</p>

        <h3>Why it's needed:</h3>
        <p>Wisdom teeth removal is necessary when:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Teeth are impacted (trapped under the gum or jawbone)</li>
            <li>They cause crowding or push other teeth out of alignment</li>
            <li>They lead to pain, infection, or damage to adjacent teeth</li>
            <li>There is a risk of tooth decay or gum disease due to difficulty cleaning the area</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Wisdom Teeth Removal Procedure:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Consultation:</strong> The dentist or oral surgeon assesses your wisdom teeth using X-rays to determine their position and condition.</li>
            <li><strong>Anesthesia:</strong> Local or general anesthesia is administered to numb the area and ensure comfort.</li>
            <li><strong>Extraction:</strong> The dentist makes an incision in the gum (if necessary) and removes the tooth. In some cases, the tooth may be sectioned into smaller pieces for easier removal.</li>
            <li><strong>Stitching:</strong> The area is cleaned, and stitches may be applied to promote healing (dissolvable stitches are often used).</li>
            <li><strong>Recovery:</strong> Gauze is placed over the extraction site to control bleeding, and aftercare instructions are provided.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Benefits of Wisdom Teeth Removal:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Prevents crowding and misalignment of nearby teeth</li>
            <li>Reduces the risk of infection and inflammation</li>
            <li>Alleviates pain and pressure caused by impacted teeth</li>
            <li>Improves oral hygiene by making the area easier to clean</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Aftercare Tips:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Apply ice packs to reduce swelling</li>
            <li>Rest and avoid strenuous activities for at least 24 hours</li>
            <li>Eat soft foods and avoid spicy, crunchy, or hot foods</li>
            <li>Rinse gently with warm salt water (after the first 24 hours)</li>
            <li>Avoid using straws or smoking to prevent dry socket</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Recovery Time:</h3>
        <p>Most patients recover within a few days, but full healing of the gum tissue may take a few weeks. Follow-up visits may be required to monitor healing and remove stitches if necessary.</p>
