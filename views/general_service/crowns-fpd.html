    <h2>Crowns and Fixed Partial Dentures (FPD)</h2>
    
    <div class="content">
        <h3>Dental Crowns</h3>
        <p><strong>What they are:</strong> A cap that covers a damaged or decayed tooth to restore its shape, strength, and function. It's typically made from porcelain, ceramic, or metal.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Why they're needed:</strong> Crowns are used to restore teeth after a root canal, to protect weakened teeth, or to improve the appearance of discolored or misshapen teeth.</p>
        
        <h3>Types of Dental Crowns:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Porcelain/Ceramic:</strong> Most natural-looking, ideal for front teeth</li>
            <li><strong>Porcelain-fused-to-metal:</strong> Combines strength and aesthetics</li>
            <li><strong>Gold alloy:</strong> Extremely durable, ideal for back teeth</li>
            <li><strong>Zirconia:</strong> Very strong and natural-looking</li>
            <li><strong>Temporary crowns:</strong> Used while permanent crowns are being fabricated</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>The Crown Procedure:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Examination and preparation:</strong> The dentist examines and prepares the tooth by removing decay and reshaping it.</li>
            <li><strong>Impressions:</strong> Digital or physical impressions are taken to create an exact model of your tooth.</li>
            <li><strong>Temporary crown:</strong> While your permanent crown is being made, a temporary crown protects your prepared tooth.</li>
            <li><strong>Placement:</strong> When your permanent crown is ready (usually 1-2 weeks later), it's cemented in place.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Fixed Partial Dentures (Bridges)</h3>
        <p><strong>What they are:</strong> Also known as a bridge, it's a prosthetic used to replace one or more missing teeth. It's anchored by crowns placed on adjacent teeth or implants.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Why they're needed:</strong> To restore the function and appearance of missing teeth, improve bite, and prevent the shifting of remaining teeth.</p>
        
        <h3>Types of Fixed Partial Dentures (Bridges):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Traditional bridges:</strong> Consist of pontics (artificial teeth) supported by crowns on adjacent teeth</li>
            <li><strong>Cantilever bridges:</strong> Used when there are teeth on only one side of the gap</li>
            <li><strong>Maryland/Resin-bonded bridges:</strong> Use metal or porcelain wings bonded to existing teeth, less invasive</li>
            <li><strong>Implant-supported bridges:</strong> Anchored to dental implants rather than natural teeth</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>The Bridge Procedure:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Adjacent teeth are prepared to receive crowns.</li>
            <li><strong>Impressions:</strong> Taken to create an exact model for fabricating the bridge.</li>
            <li><strong>Temporary bridge:</strong> Placed while the permanent bridge is being made.</li>
            <li><strong>Fitting and adjustment:</strong> The permanent bridge is checked for fit and bite.</li>
            <li><strong>Cementation:</strong> Once properly adjusted, the bridge is permanently cemented.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Caring for Crowns and Bridges:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Brush twice daily and floss regularly, paying special attention to the crown/bridge area</li>
            <li>Use a interdental brush or floss threader to clean under bridges</li>
            <li>Avoid chewing hard foods (ice, hard candy) that could damage crowns</li>
            <li>Regular dental checkups for professional cleaning and examination</li>
            <li>Wear a nightguard if you grind your teeth</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Lifespan:</h3>
        <p>With proper care, crowns and bridges typically last 5-15 years, though many can last much longer with excellent maintenance.</p>
