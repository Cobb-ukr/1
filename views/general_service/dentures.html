    <h2>Dentures</h2>
    
    <div class="content">
        <h3>What they are:</h3>
        <p>Dentures are removable prosthetic devices used to replace missing teeth. They restore the ability to eat, speak, and smile confidently.</p>

        <h3>Types of Dentures:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Complete Dentures:</strong> Full sets of artificial teeth that replace all natural teeth in the upper or lower jaw (or both).</li>
            <li><strong>Partial Dentures:</strong> Removable appliances used when only some teeth are missing. They are supported by natural teeth or implants.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why they're needed:</h3>
        <p>Dentures are essential for individuals who have lost multiple or all of their teeth. They help restore chewing function, improve speech, and prevent facial sagging caused by missing teeth. Partial dentures also help fill gaps and prevent remaining teeth from shifting.</p>
        
        <h3>The Denture Procedure:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Consultation:</strong> The dentist evaluates your oral health and takes impressions of your mouth.</li>
            <li><strong>Model Creation:</strong> A model of your dentures is made and fitted to ensure proper size, shape, and comfort.</li>
            <li><strong>Final Fitting:</strong> The final dentures are created and adjusted for fit and comfort.</li>
            <li><strong>Follow-up:</strong> You may need follow-up visits for adjustments as your gums and mouth adapt to the dentures.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Benefits of Dentures:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Restore chewing and speaking ability</li>
            <li>Enhance facial appearance by preventing sagging</li>
            <li>Improve self-confidence with a full smile</li>
            <li>Removable for easy cleaning and maintenance</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Care Tips for Dentures:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Clean your dentures daily with a soft brush and non-abrasive cleaner</li>
            <li>Soak them overnight in a denture solution to keep them moist</li>
            <li>Handle dentures carefully to avoid damage</li>
            <li>Visit your dentist regularly for adjustments and check-ups</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Adjusting to Dentures:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>It may take a few weeks to get used to speaking and eating with dentures</li>
            <li>Start with soft foods and gradually introduce harder foods</li>
            <li>Practice speaking to improve clarity</li>
            <li>If you experience discomfort or soreness, consult your dentist</li>
        </ul>
